        <h3>Most Trusted Online Medical Store Of India</h3>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">As pioneers in the healthcare segment, we understand the importance of trust. And that is why, over the years, we worked on building that trust. We ensure that every product sold through our offline/online stores are checked for their authenticity, quality, and compliance with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, the national regulatory body for Indian pharmaceuticals and medical devices.</p>

        <h3>100% Genuine Medicine From Apollo Pharmacy</h3>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">All medicines/healthcare products sold on Apollo Pharmacy are procured from our sister company - Apollo Pharmacy, with a reputation of selling only 100% genuine products. The products sold through Apollo Pharmacy are inspected thoroughly to ensure only genuine products make the cut. We believe that when it comes to medicines, quality and authenticity should never be compromised.</p>

        <h3>Over 5,600 Pharmacy Stores In India</h3>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">Our strong network lets us deliver medicines to every nook and corner of the country. We have more than **5,600 pharmacy stores in India** catering to all your medicine needs. Our network is so vast that you may find an Apollo Pharmacy store at every 1 km. We are leveraging this vast network to now become an online medical store – by getting these medicines delivered to you.</p>

        <h3>Fastest Home Delivery Of Your Order</h3>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">When it comes to medicines, most of us do not want to take a chance. This is why most of us prefer going to a store physically to get medicines. But you know what happens at the stores. First, you need to go there physically which means you have to drive/walk/ride for at least 10-15 minutes. Second, you need to wait for your turn which may come after 10-15 minutes. Third, you can only buy the products you are sure about. What if you want to buy an FMCG product but are not sure which one? You can't expect the pharmacist to give you too many options.</p>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">Apollo Pharmacy is the solution to all these. We deliver the medicines to you without you having to step out or wait in the queue to buy medicines. And we give you the option to browse through a variety of non-pharma products to choose from.</p>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">Are we missing something here? Yes, the time we take to deliver your order. We understand that you may sometimes require medicines in urgency and that is why we assure you the fastest home delivery of your medicines. Also, depending on the city you reside in, medicines can be delivered in as less as **1 hour**.</p>

        <h3>Extra Benefits Of Online Medicine Orders</h3>
        <p class="secondary-paragraph">When you order medicines at Apollo Pharmacy, not only do you get your medicines delivered on time and at your doorstep, but you also get additional benefits. You can earn **Apollo Health Credits** whenever you order medicine online and also when you purchase other non-pharma products (not applicable on discounted products including the ones where coupon codes have been applied). You can use these Health Credits to make more purchases on our platform. And not to forget the discounts and **exclusive offers** we bring out from time to time.</p>
